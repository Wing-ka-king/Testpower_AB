CAN send with pcan

- CAN messages broadcasting over peak CAN-to-USB system
- correct implementation of send_periodic realized, without using a bus to read the traffic

- 120ohm termination resistor required(most probably)
- sudo modprobe pcan, if drivers don't load upon system restart
- CAN bus display on the oscilloscope found. Needs to be verified with correct data.

- Check the ACK,CRC etc frames in the python-can message.
